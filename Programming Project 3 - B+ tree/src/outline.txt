Outline

Please find our extra test cases in main.cpp named test<number>() where number is 4 through 8. 
Test 4 sees how our code reacts to building an empty tree
Test 5 checks how our code can handle a larger number of entries in the forward direction
Test 6 checks how our code can handle a larger number of entries in a random order
Test 7 checks how our code handles inserts of negative numbers in the backward order
Test 8 checks how our code handles inserts of negative numbers in the forward order.
Each will print out in the same fashion as the first 3 test cases.

To make these tests we created the following methods:
void createRelationForward(int size);
void createRelationForwardNegative(int negNum);
void createRelationBackward(int size);
void createRelationBackwardNegative(int negNum);
void createRelationRandom(int size);

These follow the same patterns as the built in methods but take in either a size or a negative number to use for choosing what the entries will be.

We also utilized printLevel, printTree, and height to ensure our tree structure is correct, 
however we are aware that this method does not correctly unpin pages. This was not fixed because it was 
for testing purposes only and does not affect the implementation of the btree when print is not called.

Please find our design decisions in design.txt.
